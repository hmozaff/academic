## 🎓 Research Overview
My research focuses on nonlinear estimation, delay-aware filtering, robust autonomous perception, and intelligent control of dynamic robotic systems.  
I develop recursive filtering frameworks capable of handling measurement delays, asynchronous sensing, and multi-modal sensor fusion in real-time.

Key areas include:
- EKF/UKF/CKF for nonlinear systems with delay compensation  
- LiDAR–IMU–Camera fusion for autonomous navigation  
- Rigid-body state estimation with quaternion methods  
- MPC and RL-based motion planning  
- Human-centered autonomy & driver modeling
